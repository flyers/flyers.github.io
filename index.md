## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="portrait.jpg"> -->

I am currently building large language models (LLMs) at XPENG Robotics.

Before that, I haved worked in Tencent and Sea AI Lab on reinforcement learning (RL) for game AI.

I obtained my Ph.D degree in [CSE Department](http://www.cse.ust.hk/) from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk). My Ph.D supervisor was [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~dyyeung). I was a visiting scholar working with Prof. [Matt Mason](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mason/)'s Manipulation Lab in Robotics Institute of [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). Before that, I got my Bachelor Degree of Engineering in June 2014 from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) of [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn).

**We're seeking research scientist (interns) in LLM/RL/embodied AI. Please drop me an email if you're interested.**

<!-- ## Research Interest
My research interest focuses on applying computational and statistical approaches to real problems in computer vision and robotics control. Currently, I mainly work on deep learning and reinforcement learning. Especially I am interested in the  perception and control of aerial robots. -->
