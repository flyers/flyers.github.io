## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="portrait.jpg">

I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in [CSE Department](http://www.cse.ust.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk). My supervisor is [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~dyyeung). I was a visiting scholar working with Prof. [Matt Mason](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mason/)'s Manipulation Lab in Robotics Institute of [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). Before that, I got my Bachelor Degree of Engineering in June 2014 from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) of [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn).

I am especially interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems.

## Research Interest

My research interest focuses on applying computational and statistical approaches to real problems in computer vision and robotics control. Currently, I mainly work on deep learning and reinforcement learning. Especially I am interested in the  perception and control of aerial robots.
