## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="portrait.jpg">

I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in [CSE Department](http://www.cse.ust.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk). My supervisor is [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~dyyeung). Before that, I got my Bachelor Degree of Engineering in June 2014 from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) of [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn).

I am especially interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems.

## Research Interest

My Research interest focuses on applying computational and statistical approaches to real problems in computer vision and robotics control. Currently, I mainly work on deep learning and reinforcement learning. Especially I am interested in the area of visual tracking and UAV control.
